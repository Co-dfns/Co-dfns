# Obtaining and Installing the Co-dfns Compiler

## Release Cycle, Versioning

The Co-dfns compiler follows a "release when it's ready, don't hold back" 
philosophy with semantic versioning. There is only one currently supported 
release, which is the latest version. Compiler versions follow semantic 
versioning, but without the typical expectations that major versions are 
released less frequently.

The `master` branch is expected to track the versioning closely, and so the 
compiler can also be thought of as operating on a running release 
cycle/deployment model. It is important to note that master is considered 
unstable, and should not be relied on unless you are developing Co-dfns. 

## Obtaining a copy of the compiler

Always try to use the latest version of the compiler if at all possible. 
Official versions of the compiler can be found here:

https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns/releases

It may also be possible to use the master branch of the repository, but as noted
 above, this is not guaranteed to work. If a feature has recently been added to 
master that you wish to use that is not yet in a released version, please 
contact the author requesting a new release be pushed. 

## System Requirements

The Co-dfns compiler is fairly self-contained. You will need the following 
software at their latest versions:

1. Dyalog APL 64-bit Unicode edition

2. Your Operating System's host compiler:

    * Visual Studio (Windows)
    * GCC (Linux)
    * Clang (Mac OS X)

3. ArrayFire

You should be able to find the appropriate ArrayFire installer included 
in the release page for a given Co-dfns release. You can find the 
appropriate installation instructions for your operating
system here:

http://arrayfire.org/docs/installing.htm

## Loading the compiler

The source code consists of a set of utility functions defined in `ws\` 
to assist in working with the source code. The compiler proper exists in 
`cmp\` and is loaded using the `LOAD` function. 

	]link.import # ws
	LOAD'.'

This will make the `codfns` namespace available to you as well as setting up 
the testing harness.

## Building the runtime

You need to build the runtime for the compiler if you wish to use it. 

	codfns.MK∆RTM'.' ⍝ From the top-level of the Co-dfns repository

This will build the runtime in `rtm/` and also copy the necessary distributables 
to the `tests/` directory so that you can run the test suite.

By default, the runtime will be linked against the Unifed ArrayFire backend. 
However, if you wish to select a specific backend, you can provide one of the 
following left arguments to MK∆RTM:

	'cpu'		CPU Backend
	'opencl'	OpenCL (Make sure to have good drivers!)
	'cuda'		CUDA backend (Must have a CUDA capable GPU)

Other backends may be possible depending on the specific version of ArrayFire
that you have installed.

## Compiling a namespace

You can compile a namespace script using the following:

	'module_name'codfns.Fix <namespace script>

Where `<namespace script>` is the same as the output of `⎕SRC` on a scripted 
namespace (vector of character vectors).

## Using the user-command interface

You can save the codfns namespace as a file and install it into your 
user-commands directory to use the codfns compiler as a user-command.

	]save codfns .\codfns
	<Copy codfns.dyalog to your MyUCMDs directory...>
	]ureset
	]codfns.compile -??

## Running the test suite

You can run the test suite by changing into the `tests/` directory and running 
the following command:

	TEST'ALL'
